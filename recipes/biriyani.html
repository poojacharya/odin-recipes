    <h2 class="side" >Description</h2>
    <p>Mutton biryani is a flavorful, layered rice dish made with tender pieces of mutton (goat or lamb), fragrant basmati rice, and aromatic spices. It's a popular dish known for its rich, complex flavors, often cooked in a "dum" style with the meat and rice layered and slow-cooked in a sealed pot. </p>
    <h2 class="side">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>750 g mutton (bone-in pieces)</li>

        <li>1 cup thick yogurt (curd)</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp red chili powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1½ tsp garam masala powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>Juice of ½ lemon</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped mint leaves (plus extra for layering)</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped coriander leaves (plus extra for layering)</li>
        <li>2 green chilies, slit</li>
        <li>3 medium onions, thinly sliced (for birista/fried onions)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ghee</li>
        <li>A few saffron strands soaked in 3 tbsp warm milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rose water (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp kewra water (optional)</li>
        <li>Whole spices for rice: 1 bay leaf, 4 cloves, 2 green cardamoms, 1 black cardamom, 1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>Oil for deep frying (for onions)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="side">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and pat dry the mutton pieces. In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, coriander powder, lemon juice, salt, mint, coriander, green chilies, and 2 tablespoons of fried onions. Add the mutton to this marinade and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2–4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes. Boil about 6–8 cups of water in a large pot. Add salt and the whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, cardamoms, cinnamon). Once it comes to a rolling boil, add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70% done (the grain should still have a bite). Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
        <li>To make fried onions (birista), thinly slice the onions and deep-fry them in hot oil over medium heat until golden brown and crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or handi, spread the marinated mutton evenly at the bottom as the first layer.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of parboiled rice on top of the mutton. Sprinkle a generous amount of fried onions, some chopped mint and coriander, saffron milk, rose water, kewra water, and ghee over the rice. You can repeat layers if using a larger pot.</li>
        <li>Seal the pot tightly with aluminum foil or dough, then cover with a heavy lid. For stovetop cooking, place the sealed pot on a tawa (flat griddle) and cook over low heat for 40–45 minutes. Alternatively, bake in a preheated oven at 170°C (340°F) for 45–50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once done, let the biryani rest for 10–15 minutes before opening. Gently mix from the bottom while serving to get all the layers.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with onion raita, cucumber salad, boiled eggs, or Hyderabadi mirchi ka salan.</li>
